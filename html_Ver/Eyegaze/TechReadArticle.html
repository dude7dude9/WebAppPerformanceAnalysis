<h2>Real-Time Terrain Rendering</h2>



<h4>2.1. Simplifications </h4>

<p>

In polygon models, the selected sample points  are used 

to generate meshes to approximate the surfaces of terrains. 

There are mainly two kinds of polygon models. One is the 

TIN  (Triangular  Irregular  Network)  model,  and the  other 

is  the  regular  (or  semi-regular)  mesh  model  with 

subdivision  connectivity.  Comparatively,  regular  mesh 

models are more  compact and easier to be created. When 

building  finer  resolution  level,  the  elevations  of  inserted 

points  can  be  got  from  data  files  directly  without  much 

additional  computation,  A  TIN model  can  present  a 

region  with  comparatively  few  triangles,  however,  it  is 

harder  to  be  created  and  managed.  What’s  more,  every 

time  the  resolution  level  is  changed,  the  whole  model 

needs  to  be  re-created.  Its  texture  mapping  is  also  more 

complex.  Sometimes  distortions  of  textures  occur  at 

certain areas. 

</p>

<p>

When  terrain  is  small, or flat  at most  regions,  or need 

fewer  view  frustum  culling,  TIN  models  may  be  more 

efficient  to  be  handled.  When  rendering  large  terrain, 

regular  mesh  models  are  better.  Sometimes  with  the 

assistance of TINs,  regular  meshes  will be  more  efficient 

to represent  a terrain  surface  [ 1). In this paper,  we mainly 

focus  on  rendering  of  large  terrains,  so  TINs  and 

corresponding algorithms are ignored. 

The rendering time grows with the number of triangles 

sent  to  the  rendering  pipeline.  Visibility  culling  and 

LODs  are  good  ways  to  decimating  the  number  of 

vertices of meshes. 

</p>



<h5>2.1.1.  Levels  of  Detail  (LODs)</h5>  

<p>

When  talking  about 

terrain rendering,  we can never neglect  LODs.  LODs are 

now widely used in large-scale database rendering.  LODs 

can  decimate  polygons  thus  reducing  complexity  of 

computation  without  affecting  the  quality  of  scenes. 

There  are  two  schemes  to  choose  proper  LODs.  One  is 

based on the  flatness of terrain  surface.  Large  and coarse 

meshes  are  used  at  flat  regions,  while  high-resolution 

meshes  at  fluctuant  regions.  The  other  is  based  on  the 

distance  away  from  the  camera.  Regions  near  to  the 

camera are displayed in higher resolutions. 

</p>

<p>

During  pre-processing,  terrains  are  represented  as 

multi-resolution  meshes,  which  can  be  generated  from 

bottom  to  top  (or  refined-to-coarse,  in  which  a  full 

resolution  model  is  created  at  first.  Then  triangles  are 

merged recursively until  a screen space error tolerance is 

exceeded),  or  from  top  to  bottom, (or  coarse-to-refined, 

which  generates  a  coarsest-grained model  at  first,  then 

refines  it).  The  computation complexity depends  on the 

vertex number in the original mesh model. So the latter is 

much simpler.

</p>

<p>

The multi-resolution representation are arranged in one 

or more quad-trees (or its equivalent, triangle bintrees), or 

represented  as  wavelets.  At  run  time,  proper  levels  are 

selected. 

</p>



<h5>Discrete  LOD</h5>  

<p>

Because  a  terrain  height  map  is  always 

,very large, it  is  divided into  several patches with certain 

size (usually (2”n+l)  * (2“m+l)).  A patch is also called a 

tile. In order to avoid gaps in the terrain, every tile has to 

share vertices with  neighboring tiles  in  all  directions. In 

Discrete  LOD, the  LOD  model  of  every tile  is  modeled 

separately. The mesh models of all titles make up into the 

whole scene. 

</p>

<p>

With the  support  of  graphics hardware, discrete LOD 

can be  implemented very  quickly. However, the  method 

has  some  disadvantages. One  of  them  is  that  noticeable 

visual  changes  may  appear  at  the  boundary  of  different 

levels,  and  when  the  levels  changing, vertex  ‘popping’ 

also  may  be  seen.  Here,  Popping  is  a  sudden  visual 

change of  the  surface when the  geometry information is 

changed.  To  avoid  them,  the  both  levels  of  model  are 

rendered,  and  the  result  images  are  blended.  But  the 

blending may result in the occurrence of undefined image 

items.  Sometimes  at  the  boundary  of  two  levels,  T- 

junctions  or  cracks  occur.  When  a  crack  appears, 

developers often  force  it  to  a T-junction or  draw  a  little 

triangle to fill it.

<p>

Duchaineau proposed an algorithm named ROAM [2]. 

In  his  method,  a  triangle  bintree  is  used  to  manage 

triangles  and  their  relationships.  According  to  pre- 

calculated  bounded  errors,  a  triangular model  is  created 

and  modified  dynamically  using  a  greedy  subdivision 

algorithm. Splitting or  merging of  a triangle will  cause a 

chain  of  splits  or  merges  of  its  neighbors (as  shown in 

Figure  1).  So  T-junctions  and  cracks  are  avoided 

automalically and continuity of meshes is guaranteed. All 

meshes  to  be  split  or  merged  are  stored  in  two  priority 

queues,  a  split  queue  and  a  merge  queue,  separately. 

ROAM  optimizes flexible view-dependent error  metrics 

and  produces  guaranteed  bounds,  and  used  thi, =m to 

compute  the  priorities  of  splitting  and  merging  queues. 

When  high  frame-rates  are  needed,  ROAM  takes 

advantage  of  frame  coherence  to  avoid  ‘poppings’. 

However, the arrangement of two queues is complex, and 

the  robustness  is  difficult  to  guarantee.  Moreover, 

although ROAM is good at reducing polygons count, it is 

actualby  slower  than  other  algorithrns  supported  by 

today‘s hardware. 

</p>

<p>

On  the  base  of  ROAM,  Hakl  improved  a  diamond 

algorithm [3].  In this method, triangles are arranged by  a 

quad-tree, which is the equivalent of bin-tree, and 4 LIFO 

queues: are used to manage meshes to be  split  or merged. 

The  method  reduces amount of  splitting and  merging  in 

some  degree,  and  is  easier  to  be  implemented  than 

ROAM
