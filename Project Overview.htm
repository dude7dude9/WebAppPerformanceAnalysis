        Web Application Performance Analysis Project Overview</h1>
    <p>
        The main goal of the project was to investigate the key sources of inefficiency
        in web applications and the ways in which these can be mitigated. It is important
        to minimise these inefficiencies in order to provide satisfactory user experience
        while using web applications. The web operations that were investigated include
        media loading, database intensive and highly computational operations. Examples
        of each implementation of each operation can be found under the "Media", "Database"
        and "Computation" tabs at the top of the website. Each of the pages linked in the
        tab was tested independently. Multi-threading of the media and database pages was investigated 
        in the form of asynchronous request processing and the computational multi-threading utilized a
        thread pool to allocate threads. The results of multi-threading was compared to the performance results of caching.</p>
    <p>
        Various metrics were gathered using different testing tools such as &quot;Page Speed
        Test&quot;, a Google Chrome extension for single-user testing and StresStimulus 
        for load testing. The results showed that
        caching was more effective than multi-threading for most operations, although multi-threading
        did have an overall positive effect on performance. The complexity of multi-threading
        operations should be considered against the performance benefits of concurrency.
        The key sources of inefficiency were identified as those that required large amounts
        of data to be processed or returned such as image rendering. These techniques are
        recommended to be implemented in web applications involving time critical tasks
        where delays in page loads cannot be afforded.
